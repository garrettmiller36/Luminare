  \textbf{OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO PHI.}
\end{enumerate}

A. Obligations of Business Associate. Business Associate shall:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the
  Underlying Contract or as required by law;
\item
  Not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the Privacy
  Rule if done by the Covered Entity, unless expressly permitted to do
  so pursuant to the Privacy Rule and this Agreement, provided that if
  Business Associate carries out one or more of Covered Entity's
  obligations under the Privacy Rule pursuant to the Underlying
  Contract, Business Associate shall fully comply with the Privacy Rule
  requirements that would apply to Covered Entity in the performing
  those obligations;
\item
  Use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the Security Rule at
  Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to EPHI, to prevent use or
  disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by the Agreement;
\item
  Report to Covered Entity immediately, and in no case later than five
  (5) calendar days of Business Associate's discovery, any use or
  disclosure of PHI not provided for by the Agreement of which it
  becomes aware, any Breaches of Unsecured PHI as required at 45 CFR
  164.410, any security incident of which it becomes aware, or any
  breach as such may be defined under relevant state data breach laws
  (``State Law Breach''). Any notice of a Breach or State Law Breach
  referenced in this Section IV will include the results of the risk
  assessment of whether there is a low probability that the PHI has been
  compromised based on the required factors set forth in 45 CFR 164.402
  if the Breach is discovered on or after September 23, 2013, and to the
  extent possible, the identification of each individual whose Unsecured
  PHI has been, or is reasonably believed by Business Associate to have
  been accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed during such Breach.
  Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement or the Underlying
  Contract, Business Associate shall be responsible for the cost of the
  risk assessment and any breach mitigation expenses and shall
  indemnify, defend and hold Covered Entity and its officers, directors,
  affiliates, employees, agents, successors and assigns harmless, from
  and against any and all losses, claims, actions, demands, liabilities,
  damages, costs and expenses (including costs, expenses incurred in
  notifying individuals, the media or government agencies in connection
  therewith) and any judgments, settlements, court costs and reasonable
  attorneys' fees actually incurred (collectively, ``Breach Claims'')
  arising from or related to: (i) the use or disclosure of PHI in
  violation of the terms of this Agreement or applicable law, and (ii)
  whether in oral, paper or electronic media, any HIPAA Breach of
  unsecured PHI and/or State Law Breach. If Business Associate assumes
  the defense of a Breach Claim, Covered Entity shall have the right, at
  its expense, to participate in the defense of such Breach Claim.
  Business Associate shall not take any final action with respect to any
  Breach Claim without the prior written consent of Covered Entity. To
  the extent permitted by law, Business Associate shall be fully liable
  to Covered Entity for any acts, failures or omissions of its agents
  and subcontractors in furnishing the services as if they were the
  Business Associate's own acts, failures or omissions;
\item
  Make available PHI in a designated record set to Covered Entity in the
  form and format as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations
  under 45 CFR 164.524 within five (5) business days of receiving a
  request from Covered Entity;
\item
  Provide access, at the request of Covered Entity, and in no case later
  than five (5) business days after such request, to PHI in a Designated
  Record Set, to Covered Entity or, as directed by Covered Entity, to an
  Individual or third party designated by the Individual, in the form or
  format requested if it is readily producible in such form or format in
  order for the Covered Entity to meet the requirements under the
  Privacy Rule;
\item
  Make any PHI contained in a Designated Record Set available to Covered
  Entity (or an Individual as directed by Covered Entity) within five
  (5) business days of a request for purposes of amendment per 45 C.F.R.
     164.526. If an Individual requests an amendment of PHI directly from
  Business Associate or its Subcontractors, Business Associate shall
  forward the request to Covered Entity within two business days;
\item
  Maintain and make available the information required to provide an
  accounting of disclosures to Covered Entity as necessary to satisfy
  Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528. If an accounting of
  disclosures is requested by an individual directly to Business
  Associate, the Business Associate will forward the request to Covered
  Entity within two (2) business days;
\item
  To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of
  Covered Entity's obligation(s) under Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 164,
  comply with the requirements of Subpart E that apply to Covered Entity
  in the performance of such obligation(s) and to the extent any such
  obligations involve disclosures of PHI to health plans, comply with
  the requirements of 45 CFR 164.522 regarding requested restrictions on
  health plan disclosures;
\item
  Make its internal practices, books and records, including policies and
  procedures, relating to the use and disclosure of PHI available to the
  Secretary of HHS and to Covered Entity for purposes of determining
  Covered Entity's compliance with the HIPAA Rules;
\item
  Use appropriate safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other
  than as provided for by this Agreement. Implement administrative,
  physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately
  protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI as
  required by 45 C.F.R. Part 164 Subpart C (``Security Rule''). With
  respect to EPHI, Business Associate shall comply with all applicable
  state laws governing information security breaches;
\item
  Ensure that any agents and Subcontractors that create, receive,
  maintain or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree to the
  same restrictions and conditions that apply through this Agreement to
  Business Associate with respect to such information. Business
  Associate shall ensure that any agent or Subcontractor to whom
  Business Associate provides EPHI agrees to implement reasonable and
  appropriate safeguards to protect EPHI.
\item
  To the extent permitted by law, cooperate with Covered Entity to
  ensure that legal process conforms with the applicable requirements of
  the HIPAA Rules, or, if necessary in Covered Entity's opinion, obtain
  a qualified protective order to limit or prevent the disclosure of PHI
  in the event of the receipt of a subpoena, court or administrative
  order or other discovery request.
\end{enumerate}

B. Permitted Uses or Disclosures by Business Associate. Business
Associate may use or disclose PHI only:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  As necessary to perform the services set forth in the Underlying
  Contract, provided that Business Associate must be specifically
  authorized in writing by an authorized representative of Covered
  Entity to use PHI to de-identify the information in accordance with 45
  CFR 164.514(a)-(c);
\item
  As required by law;
\item
  If uses and disclosures and requests for PHI are consistent with
  Covered Entity's minimum necessary policies and procedures;
\item
  In a manner that would not violate Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 164 if
  done by Covered Entity, except that Business Associate may use PHI to
  carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate only if
  Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to
  whom the information is disclosed that the information will remain
  confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or
  for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the
  person agrees to notify Business Associate of any instances of which
  it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been
  breached; and
\item
  To provide data aggregation services relating to the health care
  operations of Covered Entity only if authorized to do so in the
  Underlying Contract.
\end{enumerate}

C. Covered Entity Privacy Practices and Restrictions.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Covered Entity shall notify Business Associate of any limitation(s) in
  the notice of privacy practices of Covered Entity under 45 CFR
  164.520, to the extent that such limitation may affect Business
  Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.
\item
  Covered Entity shall notify Business Associate of any changes in, or
  revocation of, the permission by an individual to use or disclose his
  or her PHI, to the extent that such changes may affect Business
  Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.
\item
  Covered Entity shall notify Business Associate of any restriction on
  the use or disclosure of PHI that Covered Entity has agreed to or is
  required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such
  restriction may affect Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.

\tightlist
\item

\item
  Retain only that PHI which is necessary for Business Associate to
  continue its proper management and administration or to carry out its
  legal responsibilities;
\item
  Return to Covered Entity or destroy all PHI in any form, including
  such information in possession of Business Associate's Subcontractors,
  and retain no copies, if it is feasible to do so;
\item
  If return or destruction is not feasible, extend all protections,
  limitations and restrictions contained in this Agreement to Business
  Associate's use and/or disclosure of any retained PHI, and to limit
  further uses and/or disclosures to only those purposes that make the
  return or destruction of the PHI infeasible;

  Return to Covered Entity the PHI retained by Business Associate when
  it is no longer needed by Business Associate for its proper management
