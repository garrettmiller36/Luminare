\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Take all reasonable measures to keep secret, retain in strictest
  confidence and prevent unauthorized duplication, use and disclosure of
  the Confidential Information in a manner adequate to protect the

  restrictions on duplication, use and disclosure contained in this

  appropriate remedy to assure continued maximum confidentiality.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{3. Acknowledgment by Recipient}

Each Recipient acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the provision by the
Provider of any Confidential Information to any other third party bound
by confidentiality obligations similar to the Recipient's obligations
under this Confidentiality Agreement does not render such Confidential
Information as Non-proprietary Information; (b) the Provider does not
make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness
of the Confidential Information; (c) the Provider shall have no
liability to the Recipient or any of its Representatives resulting from
any use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or any of its
Representatives; (d) this Agreement does not create a relationship of
agency, partnership, joint venture, or license between the Parties (e)
that Recipient shall use no less standard of care and protection in
preserving the confidential nature of Provider's Confidential
Information than Recipient customarily uses in preserving and
safeguarding its own proprietary and business confidential information.

\textbf{4. Internal Use and Return of Confidential Information}

The Recipient will not duplicate the Confidential Information, in whole
or in part, except within its own organization as and to the extent
necessary for the purposes of this Agreement, without, in each instance,
securing the Provider's prior written approval. At any time, upon the
request of Provider for any reason whatsoever, and within five (5) days
of such request, Recipient shall return to Provider or, at the
Provider's election, destroy and certify to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Provider to the destruction of all original copies related to the
Confidential Information and any and all copies or other reproductions
or extracts thereof, together with such documents, memoranda, notes and
other writings whatsoever, prepared by Recipient and its Representatives
based on the Confidential Information.

\textbf{5. No Grant of Rights}

The Parties acknowledge and agree that all information provided under
this Agreement is and shall remain the property of the Provider. This
Agreement shall not be construed to grant to the Recipient any rights
with respect to the Provider or its Affiliates' Confidential Information
nor create any license between the Parties under any trade secret right,
trademark, patent or copyright, applications or any other intellectual
property rights covering any part of such Confidential Information which
are now or may hereafter be owned by Provider, other than for the
purpose of this Agreement.

\textbf{6. Entire Agreement}

This Agreement supersedes all previous agreements between the Parties
regarding the Confidential Information. Therefore, this Agreement
expresses the entire Agreement between the Parties hereto with respect
to the communication and delivery of Confidential Information and shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors. This Agreement is not assignable by the
Recipient.

\textbf{7. Term}

This Agreement shall become effective on the later date of signature by
the Parties and shall remain valid for a period of the later of 5 (five)
years from the effective date or the date of disclosure. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Recipient (or its Representatives) will not be
released from its obligations hereunder until and unless (i) the
Confidential Information becomes Non-proprietary Information or (ii) the
Provider releases it by written notice

\textbf{8. Entire Agreement and Amendments}

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be
modified or amended by a writing signed by both parties. Both parties
explicitly acknowledge and agree that all subsequent oral agreements,
oral understandings and oral proposals are null and void.

\textbf{9. Waiver and Severability}

No provision of this Agreement will be waived and no breach excused
unless the waiver or consent is in writing and is signed by the party
that is claimed to have waived or consented. If any provision of this
Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in
part, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect as
if the Agreement had been executed without the invalid portion.

\textbf{10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction}

The interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, notwithstanding its
conflicts of law principles. Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based upon any right arising out of this Agreement,
shall be brought in the state or federal courts within the State of

jurisdiction of such courts and to such venue.
